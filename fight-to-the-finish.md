# Fight to a finish

The boys came back. Bands played and flags were flying,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Yellow-Pressmen thronged the sunlit street  
To cheer the soldiers who'd refrained from dying,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the music of returning feet.  
"Of all the thrills and ardours War has brought,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment is the finest." \(So they thought.\)  

Snapping their bayonets on to charge the mob,  
  Grim Fusiliers broke ranks with glint of steel.  
At last the boys had found a cushy job.  
 \* \* \* \* \*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Yellow-Pressmen grunt and squeal;  
And with my trusty bombers turned and went  
To clear those Junkers out of Parliament.
