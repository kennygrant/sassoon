# The Fathers

Snug at the club two fathers sat,  
Gross, goggle-eyed, and full of chat.  
One of them said: "My eldest lad  
Writes cheery letters from Bagdad.  
But Arthur's getting all the fun  
At Arras with his nine-inch gun."  
  
"Yes," wheezed the other, "that's the luck!  
My boy's quite broken-hearted, stuck  
In England training all this year.  
Still, if there's truth in what we hear,  
The Huns intend to ask for more  
Before they bolt across the Rhine."  
I watched them toddle through the door--  
These impotent old friends of mine.
