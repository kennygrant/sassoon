# The Investiture

God with a Roll of Honour in His hand  
Sits welcoming the heroes who have died,  
While sorrowless angels ranked on either side  
Stand easy in Elysium's meadow-land.  
Then _you_ come shyly through the garden gate,  
Wearing a blood-soaked bandage on your head;  
And God says something kind because you're dead,  
And homesick, discontented with your fate.  
  
If I were there we'd snowball Death with skulls;  
Or ride away to hunt in Devil's Wood  
With ghosts of puppies that we walked of old.  
But you're alone; and solitude annuls  
Our earthly jokes; and strangely wise and good  
You roam forlorn along the streets of gold.
