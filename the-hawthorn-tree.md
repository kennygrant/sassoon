# The Hawthorn Tree

Not much to me is yonder lane  
Where I go every day;  
But when there's been a shower of rain  
And hedge-birds whistle gay,  
I know my lad that's out in France  
With fearsome things to see  
Would give his eyes for just one glance  
At our white hawthorn tree.

Not much to me is yonder lane  
Where _he_ so longs to tread;  
But when there's been a shower of rain  
I think I'll never weep again  
Until I've heard he's dead.
