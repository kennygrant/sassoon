# Their frailty

He's got a Blighty wound. He's safe; and then

  War's fine and bold and bright.

She can forget the doomed and prisoned men

  Who agonize and fight.



He's back in France. She loathes the listless strain

  And peril of his plight.

Beseeching Heaven to send him home again,

  She prays for peace each night.



Husbands and sons and lovers; everywhere

  They die; War bleeds us white.

Mothers and wives and sweethearts,--they don't care

  So long as He's all right.
