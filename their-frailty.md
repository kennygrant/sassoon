# Their frailty

He's got a Blighty wound. He's safe; and then  
&nbsp;&nbsp;War's fine and bold and bright.  
She can forget the doomed and prisoned men  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who agonize and fight.  
  
He's back in France. She loathes the listless strain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And peril of his plight.  
Beseeching Heaven to send him home again,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;She prays for peace each night.  
  
Husbands and sons and lovers; everywhere  
&nbsp;&nbsp;They die; War bleeds us white.  
Mothers and wives and sweethearts,--they don't care  
&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as He's all right.
