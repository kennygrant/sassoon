# Introduction

As a young man in 1914, Siegfried Sassoon signed up to the Royal Welch Fusiliers. His early poetry about the war is flush with enthusiasm and what Wilfred Owen called that old lie - _Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori_. In his poem Absolution, there is no hint of the horrors to come, but instead a happy acceptance of necessary sacrifice:

> Horror of wounds and anger at the foe,  
> And loss of things desired; all these must pass.  
> We are the happy legion, for we know  
> Time’s but a golden wind that shakes the grass.

By the time Sassoon wrote The General in 1918, his view of the war had soured, bitter about the loss of life and indifference of those at home to the suffering at the front, his poems took on a darker tone, as in this excerpt from Suicide.

> You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye  
> Who cheer when soldier lads march by,  
> Sneak home and pray you'll never know  
> The hell where youth and laughter go.

In June 1917, while at Craiglockhart, Sassoon wrote an extraordinary denunciation of the war. This statement, _A Soldiers Declaration_, was read aloud in parliament by Mr Lees Smith, a prominent pacifist, and printed in _The Times_. Such was the anger at his plain denunciation of the war, the editor's windows were smashed. 

From Hansard, on the House of Commons debate 30th July 1917:

> Mr. LEES SMITH: I wish to raise the case of an individual officer which has some connection with the subject which the hon. Member for Haggerston raised. It is the case of Second-Lieutenant Sassoon, of the 3rd Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers. This young officer, I think, appears to have one of the finest and most gallant records of service in the Army. He enlisted as a private — without waiting for the War to break out — on 3rd August, 1914, and I imagine would be one of the first 1,000 men to enlist. He has been wounded, and has been awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous gallantry. He has received formal recognition from the General Commanding for distinguished service in the field. About three weeks ago this young officer came to see me, and told me he had written this letter to his commanding officer. The Under-Secretary will see that this letter raises the question of policy which has to be considered in the light of the treatment which is meted out to those soldiers who break up meetings. It raises a question of policy, and why there should be differentiation of treatment between soldiers who hold one set of opinions and those who hold another. The writer says:

From [A Solider's Declaration](a-soldiers-declaration.md):
>I have seen and endured the sufferings of the troops, and I can no longer be a party to prolonging those sufferings for ends which I believe to be evil and unjust.

Sassoon also encouraged other young poets to write, including Wilfred Owen, with whom he had a close relationship.
