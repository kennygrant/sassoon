# Introduction

As a young man in 1914, Siegfried Sassoon signed up to the. His early poetry about the war is flush with enthusiasm and what Wilfred Owen called that old lie - _Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori_.

> Horror of wounds and anger at the foe,  
> And loss of things desired; all these must pass.  
> We are the happy legion, for we know  
> Timeâ€™s but a golden wind that shakes the grass.

By the time Sassoon wrote The General in 1918, his view of the war had soured, bitter about the loss of life and indifference of those at home to the suffering at the front, his poems took on a darker tone, as in this excerpt from Suicide. 

> You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye  
> Who cheer when soldier lads march by,  
> Sneak home and pray you'll never know  
> The hell where youth and laughter go.
