# The effect

"The effect of our bombardment was terrific.  One man told me he had never seen so many dead before."

â€“ _War Correspondent_



_"He'd never seen so many dead before."_

They sprawled in yellow daylight while he swore

And gasped and lugged his everlasting load

Of bombs along what once had been a road.

_"How peaceful are the dead."_

Who put that silly gag in some one's head?



_"He'd never seen so many dead before."_

The lilting words danced up and down his brain,

While corpses jumped and capered in the rain.

No, no; he wouldn't count them any more ...

The dead have done with pain:

They've choked; they can't come back to life again.



When Dick was killed last week he looked like that,

Flapping along the fire-step like a fish,

After the blazing crump had knocked him flat ...

_"How many dead? As many as ever you wish._

_Don't count 'em; they're too many._

_Who'll buy my nice fresh corpses, two a penny?"_
