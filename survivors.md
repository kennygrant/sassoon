# Survivors

No doubt they'll soon get well; the shock and strain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk.  
Of course they're "longing to go out again,"–   
&nbsp;&nbsp;hese boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk,  
They'll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died,–   
Their dreams that drip with murder; and they'll be proud  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glorious war that shatter'd all their pride ...  
Men who went out to battle, grim and glad;  
Children, with eyes that hate you, broken and mad.  
  
Craiglockart, Oct. 1917
