# Wirers
"Pass it along, the wiring party's going out"â€“  
And yawning sentries mumble, "Wirers going out,"  
Unravelling; twisting; hammering stakes with muffled thud,  
They toil with stealthy haste and anger in their blood.  

The Boche sends up a flare. Black forms stand rigid there,  
Stock-still like posts; then darkness, and the clumsy ghosts  
Stride hither and thither, whispering, tripped by clutching snare  
Of snags and tangles.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghastly dawn with vaporous coasts  
Gleams desolate along the sky, night's misery ended.  

Young Hughes was badly hit; I heard him carried away,  
Moaning at every lurch; no doubt he'll die to-day.  
But _we_ can say the front-line wire's been safely mended.
