# To any dead officer

Well, how are things in Heaven? I wish you'd say,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I'd like to know that you're all right.  
Tell me, have you found everlasting day,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or been sucked in by everlasting night?  
For when I shut my eyes your face shows pain;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear you make some cheery old remark–   
I can rebuild you in my brain,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you've gone out patrolling in the dark.  

You hated tours of trenches; you were proud  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nothing more than having good years to spend;  
Longed to get home and join the careless crowd  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chaps who work in peace with Time for friend.  
That's all washed out now. You're beyond the wire:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;No earthly chance can send you crawling back;  
You've finished with machine-gun fire–   
Knocked over in a hopeless dud-attack.  

Somehow I always thought you'd get done in,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you were so desperate keen to live:  
You were all out to try and save your skin,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowing how much the world had got to give.  
You joked at shells and talked the usual "shop,"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck to your dirty job and did it fine:  
With "Jesus Christ! when _will_ it stop?  
Three years... It's hell unless we break their line."  

So when they told me you'd been left for dead  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't believe them, feeling it _must_ be true.  
Next week the bloody Roll of Honour said  
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wounded and missing"– \(That's the thing to do  
When lads are left in shell-holes dying slow,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache,  
Moaning for water till they know  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's night, and then it's not worth while to wake!\)  

 \* \* \* \* \*  

Good-bye, old lad! Remember me to God,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell Him that our Politicians swear  
They won't give in till Prussian Rule's been trod  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Heel of England... Are you there? ...  
Yes ... and the War won't end for at least two years;  
But we've got stacks of men... I'm blind with tears,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring into the dark. Cheero!  
I wish they'd killed you in a decent show.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
