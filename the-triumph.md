# The Triumph

When life was a cobweb of stars for Beauty who came

  In the whisper of leaves or a bird's lone cry in the glen,

On dawn-lit hills and horizons girdled with flame

  I sought for the triumph that troubles the faces of men.

###### 

With death in the terrible flickering gloom of the fight

  I was cruel and fierce with despair; I was naked and bound;

  was stricken: and Beauty returned through the shambles of night;

  In the faces of men she returned; and their triumph I found.
