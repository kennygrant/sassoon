# The Triumph  
When life was a cobweb of stars for Beauty who came  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whisper of leaves or a bird's lone cry in the glen,  
On dawn-lit hills and horizons girdled with flame  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought for the triumph that troubles the faces of men.  

With death in the terrible flickering gloom of the fight  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was cruel and fierce with despair; I was naked and bound;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;was stricken: and Beauty returned through the shambles of night;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faces of men she returned; and their triumph I found.
