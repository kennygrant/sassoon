# Joy Bells

Ring your sweet bells; but let them be farewells  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the green-vista'd gladness of the past  
That changed us into soldiers; swing your bells  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To a joyful chime; but let it be the last.  


What means this metal in windy belfries hung  
&nbsp;&nbsp;When guns are all our need? Dissolve these bells  
Whose tones are tuned for peace: with martial tongue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them cry doom and storm the sun with shells.  

Bells are like fierce-browed prelates who proclaim  
&nbsp;&nbsp;That "if our Lord returned He'd fight for _us_."  
So let our bells and bishops do the same,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder to shoulder with the motor bus.
