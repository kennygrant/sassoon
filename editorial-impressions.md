# Editorial Impressions

He seemed so certain "all was going well,"

As he discussed the glorious time he'd had

While visiting the trenches.

"One can tell

You've gathered big impressions!" grinned the lad

Who'd been severely wounded in the back

In some wiped-out impossible Attack.

"Impressions? Yes, most vivid! I am writing

A little book called _Europe on the Rack_,

Based on notes made while witnessing the fighting.

I hope I've caught the feeling of 'the Line'

And the amazing spirit of the troops.

By Jove, those flying-chaps of ours are fine!

I watched one daring beggar looping loops,

Soaring and diving like some bird of prey.

And through it all I felt that splendour shine

Which makes us win."

The soldier sipped his wine.

"Ah, yes, but it's the Press that leads the way!"
