# Autumn

October's bellowing anger breaks and cleaves  
The bronzed battalions of the stricken wood  
In whose lament I hear a voice that grieves  
For battle's fruitless harvest, and the feud  
Of outraged men. Their lives are like the leaves  
Scattered in flocks of ruin, tossed and blown  
Along the westering furnace flaring red.  
O martyred youth and manhood overthrown,  
The burden of your wrongs is on my head.
