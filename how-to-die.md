# How to die

Dark clouds are smouldering into red  
&nbsp;&nbsp;While down the craters morning burns.  
The dying soldier shifts his head  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the glory that returns:  
He lifts his fingers toward the skies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where holy brightness breaks in flame;  
Radiance reflected in his eyes,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his lips a whispered name.  
  
You'd think, to hear some people talk,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lads go West with sobs and curses,  
And sullen faces white as chalk,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hankering for wreaths and tombs and hearses.  
But they've been taught the way to do it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Christian soldiers; not with haste  
And shuddering groans; but passing through it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;With due regard for decent taste.
